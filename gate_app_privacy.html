<h1>Privacy Policy for Barda37 Gate App</h1>
<p>Last updated: 2025-11-25</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Barda37 Gate App ("the App") allows authorized residents/users to authenticate and remotely control designated gates. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices. By using the App you agree to this policy.</p>
<h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Account / Credentials:</b> Username (entered by user) for authentication and personalization</li>
  <li><b>Authentication Tokens:</b> JWT/session token stored securely to maintain login</li>
  <li><b>Permissions:</b> Gate access permissions to determine allowed actions</li>
  <li><b>Remember Me Flag:</b> Boolean preference to skip biometric on subsequent launches if user opts in</li>
  <li><b>Biometrics (Local):</b> Fingerprint/face verification status (local only, not transmitted)</li>
  <li><b>Advertising Data:</b> AdMob may collect device identifiers & usage data for ads</li>
  <li><b>Device Data:</b> IP address, device model, OS version (via AdMob/Play services)</li>
  <li><b>Audit Log:</b> When a gate is triggered, the server stores a log entry including timestamp, username, and IP address. Logs are used for security and accountability and are automatically rotated (maximum size 1MB).</li>
</ul>
<p>We do <b>not</b> knowingly collect: precise location, contacts, photos, or unrelated personal data.
    The App <b>does not</b> request access to contacts, photos, microphone, camera, precise location, or any sensitive device permissions.</p>
<h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Authenticate users and authorize gate control actions</li>
  <li>Maintain persistent login if "Remember Me" is enabled</li>
  <li>Show relevant ads via AdMob</li>
  <li>Improve reliability, security, and fraud detection</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Biometrics</h2>
<p>Biometric authentication is performed locally using device secure hardware/OS APIs. Biometric data never leaves the device and is not stored by the App.</p>
<p>Biometric authentication is optional and is controlled entirely by the device’s operating system. The App receives only a success/fail result.</p>

<h2>5. Remember Me Behavior</h2>
<p>If enabled, the App stores a flag allowing future launches to bypass biometric re-authentication until logout or disabled. For enhanced security on shared devices, keep biometrics enabled.</p>
<h2>6. Advertising (AdMob)</h2>
<p>The App integrates Google AdMob. AdMob may collect device identifiers, approximate location, and usage metrics to serve and measure ads. For details, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob Help</a>.</p>
<h2>7. Data Storage & Security</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tokens and sensitive session data are stored using secure storage mechanisms</li>
  <li>Network requests use HTTPS</li>
  <li>Only authorized gates appear for control</li>
</ul>
<h2>8. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell your personal data. Minimal data may be shared with service providers strictly to operate functionality (e.g., backend server for gate commands; Google AdMob for displaying ads). Legal requests may require disclosure.</p>
<h2>9. Retention</h2>
<p>Session tokens persist until logout or token expiry. Gate permissions refresh on login. Removing the App or clearing storage may remove local data.</p>
<h2>10. Your Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Disable "Remember Me" to enforce biometric each session</li>
  <li>Logout to clear stored token and preferences</li>
  <li>Manage ad personalization through your Google account or device settings</li>
</ul>
<h2>Account & Data Deletion</h2>
<p>You may request deletion of your account or audit log data by contacting us at the email listed below. Deletion requests are processed within 30 days.</p>
<h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is intended for authorized adult or designated resident use. It is not directed at children under 13. If underage data is discovered, contact us for removal.</p>
<h2>12. International Users</h2>
<p>Data may be processed on servers located in your country or other jurisdictions. By using the App you consent to such processing subject to applicable law.</p>
<h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy periodically. Material changes will be communicated via App update notes or in-app notice. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
